For my website project, I have decided to create a blog-like site where you can download the JavaScript code snippet for how to set up The Game of Life by John Conway. 

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a "cellular automaton" and was invented by Cambridge
mathematician John Conway. This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, 
based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the game. 

My website will also explains the depths and purpose of Code Retreat, the organization that created the JavaScript code in the first place. 

My website contains not only a home page, but also a page dedicated to the gameâ€™s creator John
Conway, a page full of resources, a page where you can download code snippet, and a page
explaining the rules. At the bottom of the home page, there will be an optional survey for the user to take.

The survey asks three text-based questions about their favorite video game of all time,
which song they would pick to sing in karaoke, and who would their first guest be if they had a
late-night talk show. The information has been gathered via the GET method and sent to
http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangluy/tools/class-content/form_tests/check_request.php.

The website I created for my class is located here: http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:26295/ <b>(might not work anymore)</b>
